# Contribution guide

## Ground Rules

A few general guidelines:

- For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
- Contributors should fork the repository and work on fixes or enhancements on their own fork.
  - Use the [pull request feature](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to submit your changes to this repository.
  - Committing directly to main is not possible.
  - All pull requests should be rebased (with main) and commits squashed prior to the final merge process.
  - Use [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) formatting for commit messages.
  - Do not combine fixes for multiple issues into one branch. Use a separate branch for each issue youâ€™re working on.
- Please include unit tests with all your code changes.
  - All unit tests must be 100% passing before the pull requests will be approved and merged.
